# cuddly-potato
Open Data Structures Textbook with Java, Scala, and Python code examples.
## Why cuddly-potato?
It is a memorable name randomly generated by github. The actual textbook will likely have a boring title, like _Data Structures using Java and Scala_ or _Object-Oriented Data Structures and Algorithms_ or something of the sort.
## How is this different from other Data Structures textbooks?
The goal of this project is to develop a textbook that can be customized to meet instructors' needs. Much of the content will be language-agnostic, leaving the option for instructors to select and modify the examples as they see fit. I will be focusing on generating code examples using Java and Scala, and Python as two possible modules. If time and energy allow, I will generate code for other languages (maybe C++).
## OER Grant
This project is being funded by a grant from the University of Pittsburgh. As per the terms of the grant, it will be released under a Creative Commons license (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0). Getting paid to generate free content makes me very happy.
