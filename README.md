# cuddly-potato
Open Data Structures Textbook with Java, Scala, and (possibly) Python code examples.
## Why cuddly-potato?
It is a memorable name randomly generated by github. The actual textbook is _Data Structures using Java_.
## How is this different from other Data Structures textbooks?
The goal of this project is to develop a textbook that can be customized to meet instructors' needs. Much of the content will be language-agnostic, leaving the option for instructors to select and modify the examples as they see fit. I will be focusing on generating code examples using Java and Scala, and (hopefully) Python. If time and energy allow, I will generate code for other languages (maybe C++).
## OER Grant
This project is being funded by a grant from the University of Pittsburgh. As per the terms of the grant, it will be released under a Creative Commons license Text (CC BY-SA 4.0), code examples will be CC0 (public domain). Getting paid to generate free content makes me very happy.
